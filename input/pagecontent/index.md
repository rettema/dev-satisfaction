* <strong>[Requirements](http://hl7.org/fhir/R5/requirements.html)</strong>

### About This Guide

During implementation guide authoring and the subsequent development of an implemenation to that guide, developers experience varing degrees of or lack thereof satisfaction in their efforts. Many developers have expressed a need for concrete and measurable methods for improving their satisfaction.

The goal of publishing this guide is to define a standard method of a Developer Satisfaction process.
