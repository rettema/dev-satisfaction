**Disclaimer:** The Developer Satisfaction Implementation Guide is a fictitious guide used to demonstrate the use of TDD techniques that accelerate the implementation of an IG.

The Developer Satisfaction Implementation Guide demonstrates the Developer Satisfaction process that can be leveraged in FHIR IG authoring and subsequent implementation efforts.

### About This Guide

During implementation guide authoring and the subsequent development of an implemenation to that guide, developers experience varing degrees of or lack thereof satisfaction in their efforts. Many developers have expressed a need for concrete and measurable methods for improving their satisfaction.

The goal of publishing this guide is to define a standard method of a Developer Satisfaction process.
